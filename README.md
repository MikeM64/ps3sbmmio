# ps3sbmmio
Graf Chokolo's ps3sbmmio Kernel Module

This is a very handy kernel module to provide access to the SB MMIO space (0x24000000000) as a kernel device.

I found this copy at: https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/cbe-oss-dev/2011-June/007393.html and have made some minor changes to get it to build cleanly on Red Ribbon Linux w/ 3.12.6 kernel.
